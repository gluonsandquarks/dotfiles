# My Dotfiles

This is my personal repo for my .config files. It is mostly a basic template which can be further configured and personalized. It uses what I mostly consider essential programs to get everything running and also have a fairly aesthetic desktop.

These dotfiles are based off the following repositories:

- [@melorin4 dotfles](https://github.com/melorin4/dotfiles)
- [@nothingButSyntaxError dotfiles](https://github.com/nothingButSyntaxError/dotfiles)
